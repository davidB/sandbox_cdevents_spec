# sandbox_cdevents_spec

Experiments with the [cdevents spec](https://github.com/cdevents/spec) to use an other format for specification of the events.
And to generate documentation and SDK's models from the spec.

To have a relevent example, the experiment provide the 3 events (`{subject}.{predicate}`) (2 on the same subject):

- `artifact.published`
- `artifact.deleted`
- `taskrun.started`
