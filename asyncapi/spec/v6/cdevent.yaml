# In this file, we start from spec 0.4 but try to be more like the documentation spec
# and to translate it into doc & sdk with some changes:
# - one type per subject
# - one type per predicate
# - remove of the subject.content, replace by subject.predicate
# - the list of predicates per subject
# - `examples` follow the format of https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-00#rfc.section.9.5 (that is different from openapi's operation)
# - `x-stage` is used to indicate the stage of the subject (and the predicates):
#   core, source-code-version-control, continuous-integration, testing,
#   continuous-deployment, continuous-operations
# - rename `type` to `kind` because `type` is a reserved word in lot of languages?
#   (on an other side if `type` is used only as discriminator (too tag enum)
#   maybe it could be removed from the generated structures)
# - for name of subject'subtype, only the first letter is capitalized (not a PascalCase)
# - for name of predicate, concatenate the subject'subtype and the predicate'subtype with predicate subtype capitalized, then
#   - predicate & subject could extracted without ambiguity (to snake_case + split on '_')
#   - no conflict between predicate that could have the same name (eg. started, finished) but different subject'subtype
# - rename `url` to `uri` (to be consistent in every place and with the type'name)
# - `$id` should be the same as the type name (like `title` in openapi, buy it is not used here)

CDEvent:

  description: |
    CDEvents is a common specification for Continuous Delivery events.

    An "event" is a data record expressing an occurrence and its context. Events are
    routed from an event producer (the source) to interested event consumers. The
    routing can be performed based on information contained in the event, but an
    event will not identify a specific routing destination.

    version:
      $ref: "#/Version"
      description: |
        The version of the CDEvents specification which the event
        uses. This enables the interpretation of the context. Compliant event
        producers MUST use a value of `0.1.1` when referring to this version of the
        specification. For more details see [versioning](https://cdevents.dev/docs/primer/#versioning).
    id:
      $ref: "#/Id"
      description: |
        Identifier for an event.
        Subsequent delivery attempts of the same event MAY share the same
        [`id`](#id-context). This attribute matches the syntax and semantics of the
        [`id`](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#id)
        attribute of CloudEvents.
    source:
      $ref: "#/Source"
      description: |
        defines the context in which an event happened. The main purpose
        of the source is to provide global uniqueness for [`source`](#source-context) +
        [`id`](#id-context).

        The source MAY identify a single producer or a group of producer that belong
        to the same application.

        When selecting the format for the source, it may be useful to think about how
        clients may use it. Using the [root use cases](https://cdevents.dev/docs/primer/#use-cases) as
        reference:

        - A client may want to react only to events sent by a specific service, like
          the instance of Tekton that runs in a specific cluster or the instance of
          Jenkins managed by team X
        - A client may want to collate all events coming from a specific source for
          monitoring, observability or visualization purposes
    timestamp:
      $ref: "#/Timestamp"
      description: |
        defines the time of the occurrence. When the time of the
        occurrence is not available, the time when the event was produced MAY be used.

        In case the transport layer should require a re-transmission of the event,
        the timestamp SHOULD NOT be updated, i.e. it should be the same for the same
        [`source`](#source-context) + [`id`](#id-context) combination.

Subject:
  type: object
  description: |
    The "subject" is the entity with which the occurrence in a software system
    is concerned. For instance when a software build is started, the build is the
    subject of the occurrence, or when a service is deployed, the subject is the
    service. Subjects belong to two main categories:

    - long running, which stay in a running state until they're purposely stopped or
      encounter a failure or a condition that prevents them from running - for
      example a service, an environment, an artifact or a source change
    - run to completion, which independently stop after they accomplished (or
      failed to) a specific task, or encounter a failure or a condition that
      prevents them from continuing - for example a task run, a build or a test
  required:
    - id

  properties:

      readOnly: true
    id:
      $ref: "#/Id"
      description: |
        Identifier for a subject.
        Subsequent events associated to the same subject MUST use the same subject
        [`id`](#id-subject).
      examples:
        - tenant1/12345-abcde
        - namespace/pipelinerun-1234
    source:
      $ref: "#/Source"
      description: |
        defines the context in which the subject originated. In most
        cases the [`source`](#source-subject) of the subject matches the
        [`source`](#source-context) of the event. This field should be used only in
        cases where the [`source`](#source-subject) of the *subject* is different from
        the [`source`](#source-context) of the event.

        The format and semantic of the *subject* [`source`](#source-subject) are the
        same of those of the *context* [`source`](#source-context).
    predicate:
      $ref: "#/Predicate"

Predicate:
  description: |
    A "predicate" is what happened to a subject in an occurrence.
    For instance in case of a software build, started is a valid predicate in the
    occurrence, or in case of a service, deployed in a valid predicate.

CustomDataContentType:
  $id: CustomDataContentType
  type: string
  description: |
    Content type of `customData` value. This attribute enables data
    to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from
    that of the chosen event format. For example, an event rendered using the
    [CloudEvents](cloudevents-binding.md) format might carry an XML payload in
    data, and the consumer is informed by this attribute being set to
    "application/xml". The rules for how data content is rendered for different
    `customDataContentType` values are defined in the specific binding
    specification
  examples:
    - application/xml
  default: application/json
